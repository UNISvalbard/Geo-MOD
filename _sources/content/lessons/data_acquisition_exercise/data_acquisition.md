# Exercise 3 - Plan your UAV-based data acquisition survey
````{margin}
```{admonition} Fieldwork
:class: note

The field data acquisition is planned for **Thursday 22nd of June, 2023**. Note that it is **highly dependant on weather conditions**.
```
````

It is now up to you to acquire your own data in the field. As discussed in previous sessions, the success of a data acquisition campaign depends greatly on survey planning.

The focus of this session is to plan and prepare everything that is needed for a UAV-based acquisition survey.

## Assignment
The well-known riverbed outcrop in Todalen is missing in the [Svalbox DOM database](http://svalbox.no/wp-content/scripts/svalbox-map/Wordpress_Map.php).

:name: todalen_outcrop1

The red dot shows the location of the outcrop. Approximate coordinates: 
```
UTM: 33X E519671 N8677658
```
```
DD.DDDDD: 78.17154°N 15.85968°E
```
```
DD MM.MMM: 78°10.292'N 15°51.581'E
```
```
DD MM SS.S: 78°10'17.5"N 15°51'34.8"E
```
````

You need to work in pairs to create an acquisition survey that will gather the most accurate data possible from this location in order to produce a digital outcrop model.

```{admonition} Equipment
:class: note

Each group will have the following equipment:

- 1 UAV (to choose between: DJI Mavic Mini 2, DJI Mavic 2 Air, DJI Mavic 2 Pro, DJI Phantom)
- 3 batteries per group
- Remote controller
- Memory card
```

To design your flight plan and focus on the outcrop, take advantage of online resources. The [AG-222 Compendium](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/content/lessons/data_mining/data_mining.html) provides an extensive list of datasets and online resources that can be helpful to you.

```{admonition} Questions to ask yourself while planning a UAV acquisition survey
:class: note

- What is the (geological) interest/purpose of the DOM?
- What factors should you consider before even acquiring the data? (e.g. scale, resolution, precision requirements?)
- What resources (e.g. batteries) do I have?
- What limitations are present and what should I expect?
- What flight pattern will I follow?
- What camera timelapse will I use?
- When are the best light conditions during the day? Should I expect many shadows in the outcrop?
- What weaknesses does the acquisition survey have?
```

### Equipment and software check
Make sure that all your batteries are charged, memory card empty, you have all software updates, etc.

### Pre-flight check list
At the very least, the following information needs to be completed before going to the field.

```
