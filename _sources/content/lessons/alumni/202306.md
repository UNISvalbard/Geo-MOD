# Group 01
In June 2023, the first group of participants in the Geo-MOD course attended [The University Centre in Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/) from the 19th to the 24th.

The course was attended by guest MSc and PhD students, as well as UNIS professors, who became experts in UAV-based photogrammetry workflow. They acquired geoscientific data, planned a survey, and became certified UAV pilots. They then digitalized and processed 2 digital outcrop models (DOMs) in Todalen, which then analyzed and published using different online resources.

You can explore some of the digital models created by the Geo-MOD Course participants in June 2023 by visiting the [Geo-MOD Sketchfab account](https://sketchfab.com/geo-mod/models).
