You can register as a:

Unless you want to register an organisation with you as a contact person, we recommend that you register as a **Private person as a drone pilot, with drone**.

Once you access to Register with ID-porten you will have to introduce your personal electronic ID. If you don't have a Norwegian electronic ID you can still register as a Foreign user, in which case you will have to create a personal account.

Once you have registered and paid the annual fee, you are allowed to fly drones under **250 grams**.

## Geo-MOD UAV certificates requirements
During the Geo-MOD course, you will fly UAVs heavier than 250 grams in the open category. Since we will not fly UAVs 120m higher than the take-off point and we will only fly them within line-of-sight, we will only need to have the certificate for the A1/A3 subcategory.
