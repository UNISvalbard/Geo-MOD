# Introduction to Geo-MOD

Welcome to the Geo-MOD Course!

The Geo-MOD Course is a module that teaches students how to collect and process AUV-based field data for geoscientific use using advanced techniques. The course is designed to be interactive and openly accessible to everyone.

Throughout the course, students will learn how to plan, execute, and process AUV-based acquisition campaigns using structure-from-motion techniques to create 3D and DEM models. The course is divided into six sessions that include a variety of engaging components, such as videos, animations, and in-person training. 

Upon completing the course, students will receive a certificate affirming their ability to independently acquire, process, and disseminate data in a scientific manner.

## Some useful definitions and terminology

Before starting with the technical parts, let's discuss some popular (and not that popular) terms such as "drone", "AUV", "UAS" or "RPA". Which one should we use?
For starters, every UAV is a drone, but not every drone is a UAV. Here's a description of the different phrases you've likely heard to help you understand what each one means and what the difference (if any) there is between them:

**Drone**
While "Drones" make most people think of "an unmanned aircraft that can fly autonomously-that is, without a human in control." It can actually be used to describe a wide variety of vehicles. For example, there are seafaring or land based autonomously vehicles that also count under the given definition of drone.

Of course, the most common usage of the term refers to an aircraft that can be remotely or autonomously guided. Unfortunately, the only thing most experts can agree on with this term is that a drone doesn't have a pilot inside.

**UAV**
A UAV is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. They are able to fly remotely such as with a controller or tablet or autonomously. So, is UAV a drone? Basically, it is. The two terms are often used interchangeably. 

However, many professionals in the industry believe UAVs need to have autonomous flight capabilities, whereas drones do not. Therefore, all UAVs are drones but not vice versa. But for now, go ahead and use the phrase you're most comfortable with! 

**UAS**
A UAS or Unmanned Aircraft Systems includes not only the UAV or Drone but also the person on the ground controlling the flight and the system in place that connects both of them. Basically, the UAV is a component of the UAS, since it refers to only the vehicle itself. 

**RPA**
Many pilots prefer the term "Remotely Piloted Aircraft." This is because flying certain types of UAVs require a lot more skill than anything you could buy in a store. Taking control of an RPA requires more than simple handheld controls.
