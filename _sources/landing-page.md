# Welcome to Geo-MOD: Teaching photogrammetry-based data acquisition
The Geo-MOD course will run at [The University Centre in Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/) between the 19-24 of June 2023.

This course is designed for students, as well as scientific and technical staff who are interested in learning or enhancing their skills in using UAV-based geoscientific data acquisition for photogrammetry in the field to produce scientifically deliverable and publishable 3D and DEM models.

UAV photogrammetry consists of three main stages:
1. Data acquisition
2. Data processing
3. Data analysis

Geo-MOD is complemented by different modules to cover each stage of the UAV photogrammetry workflow. [Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html), is a tool for UAV-based data acquisition in the field, [Geo-SfM](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-SfM/landing-page.html) is a tool for acquisition, processing and analysis of structure-from-motion photogrammetry data in the geosciences and [AG-222 Compendium](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/landing-page.html) is a tool that provides different resources for analyzing the data and publish your research.

### About Geo-MOD
[Geo-MOD](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-MOD/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the UAV-based data acquisition in the field.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Course content and learning goals
Geo-MOD course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
- Introduction to Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry
- Geo-referencing
- UAV flight regulations
- Design your own flight plan
- How to fly an UAV
- UAV data acquisition

```{admonition} Q&A
Course participants are encouraged to use [Issues](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-MOD/issues.html) on GitHub to raise questions regarding content issues so that everyone else with a similar doubt can look into it.

Alternatively, feel free to make notes and annotations through the included [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) integration.
```

### Project status
Geo-MOD is still in development, with additional tutorials and how-tos added continously to keep the work up-to-date with recent developments and evolving best practices.
