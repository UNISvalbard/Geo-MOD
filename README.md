### About Geo-MOD
[Geo-MOD](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-MOD/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the AUV data acquisition in the field.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Project status
Geo-MOD is still in development, with additional tutorials and how-tos added continously to keep the work up-to-date with recent developments and evolving best practices.
