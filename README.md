## About Geo-MOD
Geo-MOD is an open-source reference work for the AUV data acquisition in the field.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the Svalbox project, which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).
