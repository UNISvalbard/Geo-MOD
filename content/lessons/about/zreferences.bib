  abstract = {Digital Surface Models and orthoimages at high spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy is of increasing importance for many applications. From several years ago photogrammetry-UAV is being used to produce these topographic products. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of the number of Ground Control Points used for georeferencing on Digital Surface Model and orthoimage accuracies obtained with UAV-photogrammetry. In this purpose, 160 images were taken on a 17.64ha surface at 120m altitude above ground level, and five replications of photogrammetric projects taking into account 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 20 GCPs were made. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as accuracy measurement. Optimal results for RMSEX, RMSEY and RMSEXY mean{$\pm$}standard deviation values were reached for 15 GCPs: 3.3{$\pm$}0.346, 3.2{$\pm$}0.441, 4.6{$\pm$}0.340 and 4.5{$\pm$}0.169cm respectively. Similar conclusions was derived for vertical accuracy: lower RMSEZ mean{$\pm$}standard deviation values were reached for 15 and 20 GCPs: 5.8{$\pm$}1.21cm and 4.7{$\pm$}0.860cm respectively. In view of these results maps at 1:150 scale and contour interval of 15cm can be obtained from UAV-photogrammetry.},

  abstract = {Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry enables the cost-effective digital characterisation of seismic- to sub-decimetre-scale geoscientific samples. The technique is commonly used for the characterisation of outcrops, fracture mapping, and increasingly so for the quantification of deformation during geotechnical stress tests. We here apply SfM photogrammetry using off-the-shelf components and software, to generate 25 digital drill core models of drill cores. The selected samples originate from the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab project\&rsquo;s borehole DH4, covering the lowermost cap rock and uppermost reservoir sequences proposed for CO2 sequestration onshore Svalbard. We have come up with a procedure that enables the determination of bulk volumes and densities with precisions and accuracies similar to those of such conventional methods as the immersion in fluid method. We use 3D printed replicas to qualitatively assure the volumes, and show that, with a mean deviation (based on eight samples) of 0.059\% compared to proven geotechnical methods, the photogrammetric output is found to be equivalent. We furthermore splice together broken and fragmented core pieces to reconstruct larger core intervals. We unwrap these to generate and characterise 2D orthographic projections of the core edge using analytical workflows developed for the structure-sedimentological characterisation of virtual outcrop models. Drill core orthoprojections can be treated as directly correlatable to optical borehole-wall imagery data, enabling a direct and cost-effective elucidation of in situ drill core orientation and depth, as long as any form of borehole imagery is available. Digital drill core models are thus complementary to existing physical and photographic sample archives, and we foresee that the presented workflow can be adopted for the digitisation and digital storage of other types of geological samples, including degradable and dangerous ice and sediment cores and samples.},

  abstract = {Civil engineering uses digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos as basic material to be able to design and execute any project. UAV photogrammetry has made it possible to obtain this type of information in an economic and practical way. However, it is necessary to know the accuracy of the data and that it is within the admissible limits. There are many factors that affect the accuracy of products resulting from UAV photogrammetry. Of all of these, the effect of the number of ground control points (GCPs) and their distribution in the study area are especially significant. Different distributions of GCPs have been studied to try to optimize the products obtained by UAV photogrammetry. Of all the distributions tested, the best results were obtained with edge distribution and stratified distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to place GCPs around the edge of the study area to minimize planimetry errors. In addition, it is advisable to create a stratified distribution inside the study area with a density of around 0.5\textendash 1 GCP\,\texttimes\,ha-1 to minimize altimetry errors. The combination of these two distributions minimizes the total error obtained.},

  abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed `Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.},
