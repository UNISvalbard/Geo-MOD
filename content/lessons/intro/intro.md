Welcome to the Geo-MOD Course!

The Geo-MOD Course is a module to teach students how to collect and process AUV-based field data for geoscientific use using advanced techniques. The course is designed to be interactive and openly accessible to everyone.

Throughout the course, students will learn how to plan, execute, and process AUV-based acquisition campaigns using structure-from-motion techniques to create 3D and DEM models. The course is divided into six sessions that include a variety of engaging components, such as videos, animations, and in-person training. 

Upon completing the course, students will receive a certificate affirming their ability to independently acquire, process, and disseminate data in a scientific manner.

## Practical information

The Geo-MOD course will run at [The University Centre in Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/) between the **19-24 of June 2023**.

This course is designed for students, as well as scientific and technical staff who are interested in learning or enhancing their skills in using UAV-based geoscientific data acquisition for photogrammetry in the field to produce scientifically deliverable and publishable 3D and DEM models.

UAV photogrammetry consists of three main stages:
1. Data acquisition
2. Data processing
3. Data analysis

Geo-MOD is complemented by different modules to cover each stage of the UAV photogrammetry workflow. [Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html), is a tool for UAV-based data acquisition in the field, [Geo-SfM](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-SfM/landing-page.html) is a tool for acquisition, processing and analysis of structure-from-motion photogrammetry data in the geosciences and [AG-222 Compendium](https://unisvalbard.github.io/AG222/landing-page.html) is a tool that provides different resources for analyzing the data and publish your research.
