# Exercise 3 - Plan your UAV-based data acquisition survey
It is now up to you to acquire your own data in the field. However, and as it has been discussed in the previous sessions, the success of a data acquisition campign depends greatly on the survey planning.

The target: Riverbead outcrop in Todalen

### Pre-flight check list
At the very least, the following information needs to be completed before going to the field.

```
