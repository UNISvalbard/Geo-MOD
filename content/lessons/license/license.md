## UAV operation categories
OPEN: Low risk operation. No need of authorisation nor declaration.
SPECIFIC: Higher risk. Need to declare the Standard Scenarios (STS) or authorization.
CERTIFIED: High risk. Similar regulations to manned aviation.

### Open Category
The open category has three subcategories: A1, A2 and A3. In A1 you can fly small UAVs, which can be used above and near individuals. In A2 you can fly medium-sized UAVs with a defined distance from individuals and crowds. Larger UAVs in the open category are flown in subcategory A3 and away from people, buildings and recreational areas.

Certain general flight conditions are applicable for the three flight subcategories within the **open category**. These are:
1. The remote pilot will always fly in **VLOS mode** (aircraft within visual range), except when flying in follow me mode or using an unmanned aircraft observer, in which case he may use first-person vision devices (FPV, First-Person-View).

2. Flight at a height greater than **120 m** from the closest point on the surface is NOT allowed. The maximum height may be less than 120 m if the UAS geographic area defined by the authorities indicates the flight area.
```{admonition} Case example
:class: note
If a UAV is flying within 50 m, measured horizontally, of an artificial obstacle (such as a building) higher than 105 m in height, the maximum height of the UAS operation may be increased up to 15 m above the height of the obstacle, accounting for a total height of 120 m.
```

3. In the event of a conflict or encounter with a manned aircraft, the remote pilot must reduce flight height, perform evasive maneuvers in the event of a possible collision with the manned aircraft, and land as soon as possible.
```{admonition} Note
:class: note
In any case, the remote pilot must always interrupt the flight with UAS when its continuation could pose a risk to the manned aircraft.
```
 
4. Overflight of concentrations of people is not allowed and a safe distance must be maintained with people not participating in the operation.
```{admonition} Note
:class: note
The "safe distance" will depend on the subcategory of the operation. As a general rule, the heavier the unmanned aircraft, the farther it should be flown from nonparticipants to make the operation safer
```

5. An observer from the unmanned aircraft can help the pilot if he deems it appropriate. In no case is the objective of the observer to extend the flight range of the UAS beyond the visual range of the remote pilot. The observer will stand next to the pilot and will support him in the circumstances such as:
A. Help the pilot to maintain the distance to obstacles and warn him in case it is reduced. 
B. Help the pilot maintain situational awareness and warn of potential hazards.
**In any case, the remote pilot is always ultimately responsible for maintaining the safety of the UAS operation**.

6. In the open category, it is prohibited to transport dangerous goods with the UAS or to drop or project any material or object.


### Subcategory A1
In addition to the general conditions described for the "open" category, in subcategory A1 the following condition
must be met:

- Flight over non-participants is allowed, without infringing the privacy and data protection of these people, except for operations with class C1 UAS with which it  ill not be possible to fly over non-participants.
```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
The flight ban on concentrations of people is maintained!
```

### Subcategory A2
In subcategory A2 the following condition must be met:
- Flight is permitted at a safe horizontal distance of at least 30 m from non-participants, which may be reduced to a minimum of 5 m when the low speed mode function is activated, and the height will be reduced in the same proportion as the safe horizontal distance to non-participants is reduced (1:1 rule) 
```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
The flight ban on concentrations of people is maintained!
```

### Subcategory A3
In subcategory A3 the following conditions must be met:
- Fly in areas where it is anticipated that no non-participating person will be endangered for the entire duration of the flight.
- Fly a minimum safe horizontal distance of 150 m from residential, commercial, industrial and recreational areas.
```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
The flight ban on concentrations of people is maintained!
```

## Specific category
When the "open" or "certified" category requirements are not met, we would be within the "specific" category. Within this category there are the following options:

1. An operational authorization will be requested from the authority of the Member State in which it is registered, including a risk assessment with mitigation measures. Authorization may refer to:
- One or several operations.
- The approval of an LUC.

2. If the operation conforms to a standard scenario, a responsible statement will be submitted through the UAS operator profile on the AESA website.

### Standard Scenarios (STS)
Execution Regulation (EU) 2019/947 defines two standard scenarios in which certain requirements are indicated, some of which are not applicable today due to technical limitations.

European Standard Scenarios:
- STS-01
- STS-02
