##  UAV Flying license in Europe
The flying regulations in the European Union are established by EASA ([European Union Aviation Safety Agency]/(https://www.easa.europa.eu/en). Norway follows the same regulations as the rest of the EU state members. 

To fly UAV in Europe, you must be a registered pilot. Registering as a drone pilot is a relatively straightforward process, but you need to fulfill the following requirements:
1. You must be at least 16 years old to register as a drone operator.
2. In Norway, you have to pay a yearly fee of 220 nok.
3. Register with ID-porten if you have a Norwegian national identity number or a D-number even if you are a foreign citizen.

```

You can register as a:
- Private person as a drone pilot, with drone
- Pilot for an organisation
- Organisation or company as a drone operator

Unless you want to register an organisation with you as a contact person, we recommend that you register as a **Private person as a drone pilot, with drone**.

Once you access to Register with ID-porten you will have to introduce your personal electronic ID. If you don't have a Norwegian electronic ID you can still register as a Foreign user, in which case you will have to create a personal account.

Once you have registered and paid the annual fee, you are allowed to fly drones under **250 grams**. 

## UAV flying categories
The open category has three subcategories: A1, A2 and A3. In A1 you can fly small UAVs, which can be used above and near individuals. In A2 you can fly medium-sized UAVs with a defined distance from individuals and crowds. Larger UAVs in the open category are flown in subcategory A3 and away from people, buildings and recreational areas.

### Geo-MOD UAV certificates requirements
During the Geo-MOD course, you will fly UAVs heavier than 250 grams in the open category. Since we will not fly UAVs 120m higher than the take-off point and we will only fly them within line-of-sight, we will only need to have the certificate for the A1/A3 subcategory.

```{admonition} Requirement
:class: tip
To fly drones as part of the Geo-MOD course, it is a mandatory requirement to have the subcategories **A1/A3** certificate of competence to fly UAVs. 
```

After registering as a UAV operator in [flydrones.no](flydrones.no), you can access the A1 and A3 subcategories online courses and exams. You get access to the exam after completing the online course. (Remember to click through all pages, including control questions for the course to be marked as complete.)

Once you have passed the A1 / A3 certificate of competence, download it from "My page" on flydrones.no.
