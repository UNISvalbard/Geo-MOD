# Geo-MOD UAV certificates requirements
During the Geo-MOD course, you will fly UAVs heavier than 250 grams in the open category. Since we will not fly UAVs 120m higher than the take-off point and we will only fly them within line-of-sight, we will only need to have the certificate for the A1/A3 subcategory.

```{admonition} Requirement
:class: warning
To fly drones as part of the Geo-MOD course, it is a mandatory requirement to have the subcategories **A1/A3** certificate of competence to fly UAVs.

After registering as a UAV operator in [flydrone.no](https://flydrone.no/register), you can access the A1 and A3 subcategories online courses and exams. You get access to the exam after completing the online course. (Remember to click through all pages, including control questions for the course to be marked as complete.)
