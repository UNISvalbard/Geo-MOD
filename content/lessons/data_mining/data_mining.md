# Data mining and data integration

This module covers the basic online resources to find the information you need to conduct research in Svalbard.


**Main learning objectives**

This course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
The main learning objectives are:
- Familiarize and use Svalbox online portal
- Familiarize and use online resources
- Find out information 
- Present your findings to the class

**Data sets and resources**

The following provides a short overview of the most relevant resources for this module (and for the entire course):
- Course material is provided on the AG222 Teams folder – use your UNIS credentials to log in.
- We have set up a course data server, accessed from the UNIS network (also via VPN), under  \\svalbox\AG222 (again, use your UNIS credentials to log in).

2. Take screenshots of a selection of 15 good quality partly overlapping images and save for future photogrammetry project.

```


### 5. ResearchInSvalbard

The RiS database is a useful portal to find out what research was done in Svalbard. 
As with all databases it has some issues (the major one being that there are many projects there that were never conducted for a variety of reasons), but overall it is a very useful tool to get an overview and plan your research so that you don’t do double-work. It can also help in logistical co-ordination between different field groups.
Access it at [https://researchinsvalbard.no/](https://researchinsvalbard.no/) and try to figure out the tasks below.

```{figure} assets/6_research_in_svalbard.png
:name: 6_research_in_svalbard

Example of a project search in the ResearchInSvalbard database.
```

```{admonition} Task
:class: tip
1. Where have geologists worked on Svalbard in the summer of 2019? 

2. What about from 2005 to 2015?

3. What was the objective of the fieldwork?

4. What methods did they use?

5. Did they publish any results?

6. From which country/institute did they come?

7. List ca. 10 different campaigns in an appropriate table.
``` 


### 6. Norwegian Petroleum Directorate FactMaps

The Norwegian Continental Shelf is – thanks to petroleum activity – one of the most data-rich part of the world, with thousands of exploration wells, and millions of kilometres of 2D and 3D seismic surveys.  This allows much quality geoscientific research, and also provides a framework for offshore CO2 storage (ongoing at Sleipner since 1996, Snøhvit since 2008 and Aurora starting now/Longship project).
All data are owned by the companies who gather them, but become public after 2 years (raw well logs), 5 years (seismic data) and 20 years (interpretations, reports etc.). The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) manages this immense data set, and also offers useful FactPages and FactMaps to look up – see [https://www.npd.no/en/](https://www.npd.no/en/).
The only downside is that while Svalbard is geologically certainly part of the Barents Shelf, politically it is not, and Svalbard exploration data (see Petroleum, coal and research drilling onshore Svalbard: a historical perspective) is not readily available.

```{figure} assets/7_1_map_npd.png
:name: 7_1_map_npd

NPD FactMap from the Norwegian coast and Svalbard.
```

```{figure} assets/7_2_factmap_npd.png
:name: 7_2_factmap_npd

```

##### Use the NPD FactMaps to address the following tasks:

```{admonition} Task
:class: tip
1. Where are the exploration wells? 

2. What is the northernmost well? 

3. When was the last exploration well drilled?

4. Which areas are currently licensed by oil companies?

5. Which areas are licensed on the Russian side of the border? (hint: - see [http://wwfarcticmaps.org/](http://wwfarcticmaps.org/))

6. What are the main geological elements? 

7. What is the age of the structures?
``` 

### 7. Article search and methods

Science is not about starting from scratch, but about contributing new knowledge to existing ones. You thus need to know what is the state of the art, and efficiently use referencing. UNIS has a license for EndNote reference manager which we will be using in the course. It allows automatic importing of references, and including pdfs of the references, for easy archiving.

````{note}
To install EndNote at UNIS, connect to Software Center, search for EndNote and click install.

```{admonition} Your computer
:class: tip
You can download it to your personal computer using the Svalbox student server, access to the following directory  \\svalbox\AG222-2022\AG222\Software\EndNote to download EndNote.

```
````

EndNote is a desktop reference management and bibliography creation software. It exists to make your life easier when citing the sources you use for your work.
The first step is to create a new library where you can save your favorite articles.

```{figure} assets/7_endnote.gif
:name: 7_endnote


```

Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/) is linked with it. To do so, you have to select Cite and add to EndNote. It will be a downloadable file that automatically links to your Library.

```{figure} assets/7_2_scholar.gif
:name: 7_2_scholar


```

In Word, we can insert the citation of the paper we are using. Moreover, it will automatically insert the full reference in the bibliography.

```{figure} assets/7_3_word.gif
:name: 7_3_word


```

Finally, we can edit the way the citation displays and the style we are required to use. 

```{figure} assets/7_4_reference.gif
:name: 7_4_reference


```

```{figure} assets/7_5_style.gif
:name: 7_5_style


```

```{admonition} Task
:class: tip
1. Search for 5 relevant articles each using Google Scholar.

2. Load these into your EndNote library and include the .pdf file.

3. Each group to deliver a document including EndNote library of 20 articles and 3 corresponding word document with the bibliographic style of Geology, Earth-Science Reviews and Nature.

4. Focus on the data and methods of each paper.
- What have the researchers been doing?
- Could you reproduce their research?
- What is done well, and what could be improved in the articles?
```


```{note}
There are other free and open access softwares for reference management and bibliography creation. One example is Mendeley.

```

### 8. SvalSIM – the svalbard Geosimulator

```{note}
Using the [Svalbox student server](../lessons/svalbox_server/svalbox_server "svalbox_server.md"), access to the following directory  \\svalbox\AG222-2022\AG222\Software\SVALSIM to download SVALSIM.
```

Copy the SvalSim folder from the Svalbox student server to your local PC C-drive, in the folder Program files.

```{figure} assets/8_1_folder.png
:name: 8_1_folder


```

To start the geosimulator, double click to the file SvalSim.bat

```{figure} assets/8_2.png
:name: 8_2


```

Click to **Continue** for the first to pages, and using the SvalSim as standard user click on **Enter**.

The SvalSim opening page will start. You are now ready to travel and open up the information menu.

Clicking the overview button, you get a map indicating your current position as a red dot.
The white arrow in the menu shows you the view direction.
In this way you know where you are in the 3D landscape.
You can also read out:
- X-coordinate
- Y-coordinate
- Elevation
- Speed (when flying)

```{figure} assets/8_3.png
:name: 8_3


```

```{note}
Almost all information in the geosimulator are geo-referenced, that means: by choosing a data object, either via the folder or via an icon, you can go to the right position (and direction).

```



```{admonition} Task
:class: tip
1. Is there any data available for your area?

2. Make screenshots of relevant views of your study site.

3. Consider using SvalSIM to “film” your journey from Longyearbyen to your field area.
